## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
when i learned to edit the HTML file i noticed this code

```
backgroundColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)'
              ],
              borderColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)',
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132)'
              ],
```
In this code the rgba(#RED, #GREEN, #BLUE, #OPACITY), the scale between the red green and blue is from 0 to 255 max, and the opacity if you don't need it just don't add it the system will recognized it as no amount.

and it has 7 columns because in the file it has monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday,...., sunday which is 7 days

## Continued development
These are the things that i found useful when creating this html assignment, the rgba() function, this is very important to me wif i need to create a chart like this in the future, the exact amount and the color values it needs for my projects.
